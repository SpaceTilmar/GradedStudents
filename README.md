# Chapter 5

When developing a class start with pseudocode/test code. Program in pairs, switching frequently. Refactor. Small/frequent changes.

For loops over while loops when you know repetition of code.

Can change primitive data types with type casting. Casting tells compiler to chop type into a smaller type.

# Chapter 6

Java libraries are pre-built classes that act like building blocks.

Every class in java library belongs to a package.

ArrayList is an adjustable array that can be added to, removed from, and set.

ArrayList only holds objects.

READ DOCUMENTATION!!!

# Chapter 7

Plan for future.

IS VS HAS: Is is associated via inheritance. Has is relation but no inheritance.

Overloading means have two methods of the same name but with different args. NOT POLYMORPHISM.

# Chapter 8

Some classes should not be instantiated.

Class can implement multiple interfaces and does not need to follow inheritance tree.

Difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that interfaces can be applied to several classes with no relation.

# Chapter 9

Instance variables reside within object.

Constructors must have the same name as the class and cannot specify return.

Constructor intializes state. Compiler will automatically provide default constructor if none is specified.

Instance variables are automatically assigned default values, such as 0, 0.0, or false for primitives, and null for reference types if not explicitly initialized.
